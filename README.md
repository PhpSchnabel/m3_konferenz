Time series are an omnipresent data type. Data, generated by business processes
or connected devices, are essentially time series. Sales, inventory in
warehouses or the condition of a car battery measured over time, are other
examples. Quickly the number of series growth such that a human can not observe
them in an easy and economical way. There comes algorithmical methods and
machine learning to the rescue to detect anomal behavoir and to forecast. We
present and introduce modern ML algortithms, which get integrated into a data
architecture. To make the algorithms practically usable for the audience
we apply the algorithms on public dataset and provide ready to use notebooks.

During the talk we used two main demo-datasets. 

## Smart Meter London
In this dataset, you will find a refactorised version of the data from the
London data store, that contains the energy consumption readings for a sample
of 5,567 London Households that took part in the UK Power Networks led Low
Carbon London project between November 2011 and February 2014. The data from
the smart meters seems associated only to the electrical consumption.

A detailed data description can be found on Kaggle: Kaggle: 
[Smart Meters in London](https://www.kaggle.com/jeanmidev/smart-meters-in-london).

## Event Time Analysis
We have a fleet of 100 aircraft engines of the same model. Each engine starts
with different unknown degrees of initial wear and manufacturing variation
which is considered normal. Each engine is operating at normal conditions at
the beginning of the time series but degrades over time until a predefined,
unknown failure threshold is reached. The objective is to predict from any
point in time how long we have until we need to perform maintenance.
